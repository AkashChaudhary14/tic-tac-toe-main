# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe game board.
3. Two players take turns clicking on empty cells to make their moves.
4. Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
5. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
7. You can click the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game board and includes the necessary scripts and styles.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides the visual styling for the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the game logic and interactions.

## Customization

You can customize the game's appearance and behavior by modifying the CSS styles and JavaScript code. Feel free to experiment with different designs, animations, or additional features.
